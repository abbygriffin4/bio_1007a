For my final project, I have chosen to reproduce some graphs from past Biology classes and ones that I use in my research. 

Graph 1 from "Hindrance of Plastoquinone Photosynthetic Activity in *Spinacea oleracea* Chloroplasts by the Herbicide Atrazine", BIOL 0145, Spring 2020.
1. First, I had to find my old data, clean it up by rearranging the rows/columns so it would be easier to make a data frame as well as delete any extra data calculations off to the side. I exported this cleaned data as a .csv to my 'data' folder in my project directory.
![What my clean data looks like](images/finalprojpics/1.png){width=50%}

2. Now, I'm going to import my data to RStudio and do the same analyses I had to do in Excel.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
ATZData<-read.table(file="data/griffin_atrazine_photosynthesis.csv", header=TRUE, sep = ",")
```

2. Find the mean absorbance for each time point and create a new df with these values
``` {r}
# I tried this first, but it seemed like there had to be a simpler way, plus R would not let me use a numeric operator (+) on a non-numeric argument:
# ATZData_avg<- summarize(aggregate(ATZData$X0, list(ATZData$Sample), FUN=mean) +
# aggregate(ATZData$X3, list(ATZData$Sample), FUN=mean) +
# aggregate(ATZData$X6, list(ATZData$Sample), FUN=mean) +
# aggregate(ATZData$X9, list(ATZData$Sample), FUN=mean) +
# aggregate(ATZData$X12, list(ATZData$Sample), FUN=mean) +
# aggregate(ATZData$X15, list(ATZData$Sample), FUN=mean))

# Then I successfully bound together the data by time (y) and separated the mean at each time by sample

ATZData_avg<-aggregate(cbind(X0,X3,X6,X9,X12,X15) ~ Sample, data = ATZData, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)


```

3. This is the same table I have in Excel, but I ran some statistical analyses on the data to double check.
```{r}
summary(ATZData_avg)
glimpse(ATZData_avg)
```

4. Now I'm going to plot my data using `geom_point`.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)


ATZData_longer <- ATZData_avg %>%
  pivot_longer(X0:X15), names_to = "time", values_to = "absorbance") 
print(longer_data)

library(plyr)
ATZData_renamed<-plyr::rename(ATZData_longer, c(X0 = 0,
       X3 = 3,
       X6 = 6,
       X9 = 9,
       X12 = 12,
       X15 = 15)) # had to load plyr package in order for me to stop receiving "these columns don't exist" error
ATZData_renamed$time <- as.numeric(as.character(ATZData_renamed$time))


as.numeric(ATZData_renamed, time)
ggplot(ATZData_renamed, aes(time, absorbance) +
         geom_point())
```
